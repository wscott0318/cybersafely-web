## How The CyberSafely.ai™ Pilot Program Works

The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program is designed to help protect children by:
- Scanning student social media activity to identify situations involving bullying, sexual content, suicide, or the illegal use of weapons.
- Notifying trusted individuals via automated alerts in the event concerning social media activity is detected.
- Helping today's youth be more aware of how their future can be affected by their behavior on social media.

The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program works as follows:
- A school or school district agrees to make The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program available to students and their families.
- A school administrator, coach, or other school official adds eligible students to The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program. This will include the student's name and school email address and, if the student is under the age of 18, the name and email address of the student's parent or guardian on record.
- If the student is under the age of 18:
    - An email is sent to the student's parent or guardian inviting them to complete setting up their parent account.
    - After completing the account setup, the parent or guardian will be asked to complete a Consent Form.
    - Once the parent or guardian completes the Consent Form:
        - The parent or guardian will be able to provide one or more email addresses or mobile phone numbers which will be used by The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program to send automated alerts if concerning activity is detected.
        - The student will be provided instructions on how to connect their social media accounts to The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program.
- If the student is over the age of 18:
    - An email is sent to the student inviting them to complete setting up their student account.
    - After completing the account setup, the student will be asked to complete a Consent Form.
    - Once the student completes the Consent Form:
        - The student will be able to provide one or more email addresses or mobile phone numbers which will be used by The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program to send automated alerts if concerning activity is detected.
        - The student will be provided instructions on how to connect their social media accounts to The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program.
- After obtaining the student's, parent's or legal guardian's consent (as appropriate), all posted text, images, videos, or other materials, along with any likes, shares, and other similar social media activity will be scanned by The **CyberSafely.ai™** software for automated analysis.
- If any individual activity, or combination of activities, meets The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program's predetermined criterion indicating concern, an automated alert will be sent to the individuals designated in the dashboard indicating the nature of the alert.

In addition, The **CyberSafely.ai™** Program will periodically send educational material to students, parents, and guardians on safe social media use and how to identify unsafe behavior.
